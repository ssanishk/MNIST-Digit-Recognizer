# MNIST Digit Recognizer

A small project undertaken to get an hands on experience using CNN's and other Computer Vision techniques.

The dataset is commonly available for download. I've made the dataset availabe [here](https://github.com/ssanishk/MNIST-Digit-Recognizer/tree/master/Dataset) in the same repository

## Methodology

The method adopted was to simply to create a model as shown below and accordingly format the given data to be fed into the model for training/testing.

Kindly refer to the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ssanishk/MNIST-Digit-Recognizer/blob/master/MNIST.ipynb) for detailed step by step explanation of the method adopted.

## Results

The accuracy and test loss as evaluated on the test dataset.

|Test Loss|Test Accuracy  |
|--|--|
|  0.0345| 99.2% |
