# MNIST Digit Recognizer

 A small project undertaken to get an hands on experience using CNN's and other Computer Vision techniques.
 
 Problem Statement  : [https://www.kaggle.com/ngbolin/mnist-dataset-digit-recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/ngbolin/mnist-dataset-digit-recognizer)
The DataSet was downloaded from the Kaggle database 

## Methodology

The method adopted was to simply to create a model as shown below and accordingly format the given data to be fed into the model for training/testing.

Kindly refer to the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ssanishk/MNIST-Digit-Recognizer/blob/master/MNIST.ipynb) for detailed step by step explanation of the method adopted.
